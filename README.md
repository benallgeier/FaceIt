# FaceIt

A project based based on Stanford's iPhone course.

An iOS app (for iPhone and iPad) that shows various faces. User can interact with the faces with gestures. Tapping toggles the eyes open/closed. Swiping up and down changes the smile or frown level. Rotating changes the brow angles. And pinching zooms in and out.
